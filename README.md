<h1 align=center>OpenAddresses Batch</h1>

## Deploy

Before you are able to deploy infrastructure you must first setup the [OpenAddresses Deploy tools](https://github.com/openaddresses/deploy)

Once these are installed, you can create the production stack via:
(Note: it should already exist!)

```sh
deploy create production
```

Or update to the latest GitSha or CloudFormation template via

```sh
deploy update production
```

### Paramaters

#### GitSha

On every commit, GitHub actions will build the latest Docker image and push it to the `batch` ECR.
This parameter will be populated automatically by the `deploy` cli and simply points the stack
to use the correspondingly Docker image from ECR.
